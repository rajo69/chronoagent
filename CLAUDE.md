## Current Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Current phase** | Phase 5: Decentralized Task Allocator |
| **Next task** | 5.5, `db/models.py` `AllocationAuditRecord` (task_id, assigned_agent, all_bids JSON, health_snapshot JSON, rationale, escalated) + Alembic migration |
| **Blocked?** | No |
| **Last session** | 2026-04-10. Phase 5 task 5.4 done [x]. Branch `feat/phase5-task5.4-graph-integration` cut off `main`. `src/chronoagent/pipeline/graph.py` now wires the allocator into the StateGraph: new `allocate_security` / `allocate_style` nodes each call `DecentralizedTaskAllocator.allocate(f"{pr_id}::{task_type}", task_type)` and write a `NegotiationResult` into dedicated state fields (`security_allocation`, `style_allocation`). LangGraph `add_conditional_edges` routes each branch via `_route_security` / `_route_style`: specialist branch only fires when `assigned_agent` matches the expected specialist AND `escalated is False`; otherwise the branch drops into a new `escalate_security` / `escalate_style` node that emits a zero-finding placeholder `SecurityReview` / `StyleReview` with `recommendation="escalated: {rationale}"` and `raw_response={rationale}` so the summarizer still produces a report and the audit layer (5.5) can reconstruct why. `ReviewPipeline.__init__` takes an optional `allocator: DecentralizedTaskAllocator | None`; when `None`, a default allocator is built on a fresh in-process `LocalBus`, so the empty cache + `missing_health_default=1.0` makes every specialist bid 1.0 and the behaviour is byte-for-byte identical to the pre-5.4 topology (all 17 legacy pipeline tests pass unchanged). `PipelineState` gained `security_allocation` and `style_allocation` (no list reducer needed). 9 new tests in `tests/unit/test_pipeline_graph.py::TestAllocatorGating`: default routes to specialists, explicit full-health routes the same way, non-specialist winner routed to escalation (with full matrix math in the docstring), all-low-health double escalation, public `run()` survives full escalation, task IDs carry pr_id + task_type for audit correlation, explicit allocator injection, default allocator instantiated internally, compiled graph exposes all 8 expected node names. Total 629 tests pass (620 + 9). `pipeline/graph.py` 100% covered (142/142); full suite 93.39%. All 4 CI checks green locally (ruff check, ruff format, mypy --strict on 55 files, pytest --cov). |

## How to Start a Session

```
1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md). You now have full context
2. Read only the current phase section from PLAN.md
3. Pick the next unchecked [ ] task
4. Implement → write test → make test green → [x]
5. Update "Current Status" table above before ending session
```

---

## Git Workflow

```
main          protected, never commit directly
feat/*        new features (one per phase task is fine)
fix/*         bug fixes
chore/*       config, CI, docs, refactor
```

**Branch per task:**
```bash
git checkout -b feat/phase0-pyproject    # start task
# ... implement + test ...
git add <specific files>                 # never git add .
cz commit                                # conventional commit prompt
git push origin feat/phase0-pyproject
gh pr create --base main                 # open PR
# CI must be green before merge
```

**Commit format (enforced by commitizen):**
```
feat(scope): short description
fix(scorer): handle zero-variance KL-div
chore(ci): add mypy strict step
docs(readme): add architecture diagram
test(allocator): add negotiation invariant tests
```

**Never:**
- `git add .` or `git add -A`, always add specific files
- Commit directly to `main`
- Skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`)
- Commit `.env` files

## Dev Practices (enforced every task)

| Practice | Tool | When |
|----------|------|------|
| Lint + format | `ruff` | pre-commit + CI |
| Type checking | `mypy --strict` | pre-commit + CI |
| Commit message | `commitizen` | pre-commit |
| Test coverage | `pytest --cov` | CI (min 80%) |
| Dependency lock | `uv` + `requirements.lock` | CI installs from lock |
| Type hints | manual | every new function |
| Docstrings | manual | every public function |

**Test rule:** Write the test in the same session as the implementation, before moving to the next task. `make test` green = task done.

**Phase 1 exception:** Research experiment, no unit tests. Gate = measured signal results plus GO/NO-GO decision.

**Prose style rule (project-wide):** Never write em dashes (Unicode U+2014) in any file: README, docs, PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md additions, code comments, docstrings, commit messages. Use commas, colons, parentheses, semicolons, or two sentences instead. The hyphen `-` and en dash `–` are fine.

**README update rule:** Update the "Project status" section of `README.md` at the close of every phase. Tick the phase, update the test count and coverage, and add a one-line "Currently:" note. The README, `CLAUDE.md`, and `PLAN.md` stay in sync at session end.

## Stack Quick-Ref

| Component | Choice | Note |
|-----------|--------|------|
| LLM (real) | Together.ai | Default. Get key at api.together.ai |
| LLM (tests/experiments) | MockBackend | Zero cost, deterministic |
| LLM (optional) | Ollama | GPU only, skip |
| Forecaster | Chronos-2-Small + BOCPD | CPU-safe. Async. |
| Agents | LangGraph + LangChain | |
| Memory | ChromaDB | |
| API | FastAPI | |
| Messaging | Redis pub/sub | |
| DB | SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) | |
| Dashboard | FastAPI + HTML/Chart.js | No npm build step |
| Container | Docker + Compose | |

---

## Key Commands

```bash
make dev              # start FastAPI with hot reload
make test             # pytest unit + integration (MockBackend, no API calls)
make lint             # ruff + mypy
make docker-up        # full stack
cz commit             # conventional commit
cz bump               # bump version + changelog
pre-commit run --all  # run all hooks manually
chronoagent run-experiment --config configs/experiments/signal_validation.yaml --output results/
```
